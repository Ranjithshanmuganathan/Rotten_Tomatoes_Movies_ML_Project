Data Collection and Processing:

Collect movie metadata (title, genre, cast, release year, etc.).
Extract and preprocess audience and critic reviews.
Handle missing data, outliers, and categorical encoding.
Sentiment Analysis:

Apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify review sentiments (positive, neutral, or negative).
Use pre-trained models like BERT or fine-tune custom models for improved performance.
Rating Prediction:

Build regression models to predict movie ratings based on metadata and sentiment data.
Train and test models using algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize correlations between factors like genre, release year, and ratings.
Identify trends in critic vs. audience ratings over time.
Model Evaluation:

Compare models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, F1-score, and accuracy.
Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Insights and Recommendations:

Analyze key features contributing to high/low ratings.
Provide recommendations to studios and filmmakers based on audience sentiment trends.
Deployment:

Deploy a web-based or app-based platform where users can input movie details or reviews and get predicted ratings or sentiment analysis.
Integrate with APIs to fetch real-time data from Rotten Tomatoes or similar platforms.
